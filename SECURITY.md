# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**If you believe you have discovered a security issue within DzzenOS-OpenClaw, please open a new private security
vulnerability report through GitHub:
https://github.com/Dzzen-com/DzzenOS-OpenClaw/security/advisories/new

Alternatively, reach out to us directly over email: [team@dzzen.com](mailto:team@dzzen.com).**

We will then open a GitHub Security Advisory for tracking the fix on your behalf.

Dzzen values the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work with
our team so that proper fixes can be issued to users.

In order to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:

- Do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Dzzen team releasing a fix for it.
- Do not divulge exact details of the issue, for example, through exploits or proof-of-concepts.
