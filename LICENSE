The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative

commercial license from the Licensor, its affiliated entities, or authorized
resellers, or you must refrain from using the Licensed Work.

All copies of the original and modified Licensed Work, and derivative works

separately for each version of the Licensed Work and the Change Date may vary
for each version of the Licensed Work released by Licensor.

You must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy

Covenants of Licensor

In consideration of the right to use this License's text and the "Business
Source License" trademark, Licensor covenants to MariaDB, and to all other
recipients of the licensed work, that Licensor will:

1. Specify as the Change License the GPL Version 2.0 or any later version, or
   a license that is compatible with GPL Version 2.0 or a later version,
   where "compatible" means that software provided under the Change License
   can be included in a program with software provided under GPL Version 2.0
   or later version. Licensor may specify additional Change Licenses without
   limitation.

2. Either:
   a. Specify an additional grant of rights to use that does not impose any
      additional restriction on the right granted in this License to use in
      non-production; or
   b. Specify additional restrictions on the right granted in this License to
      use in production, provided that such additional restrictions are
      consistent with the definition of "Production Use" below.

3. Specify a Change Date that is no more than four years from the date of the
   first publicly available distribution of the Licensed Work under this
   License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Use Grant (Free Production Use for Small Organizations and Client Installations)

Notwithstanding the "Production Use" restriction in this License, you are granted a free,
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive right to use the Licensed Work in Production,
without payment of fees to the Licensor, provided that:

1. Your organization’s Annual Gross Revenue is less than USD 1,000,000 (one million US dollars)
   in the most recently completed fiscal year; or your organization is a new business that has
   not yet completed its first fiscal year.

2. If you are a consultant, agency, or service provider deploying or configuring the Licensed Work
   on infrastructure owned or controlled by your client, your client’s Annual Gross Revenue satisfies
   the condition in (1) above. In that case, your client is deemed the "Licensee" for the purpose of
   this Additional Use Grant.

This Additional Use Grant does not permit you to:
- offer the Licensed Work, or any modified version of it, as a hosted or managed service to third parties,
  except on infrastructure owned or controlled by such third parties under the conditions above;
- resell, rebrand, or otherwise market the Licensed Work as your own product without a separate commercial
  agreement with the Licensor.

All other Production Use requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.
