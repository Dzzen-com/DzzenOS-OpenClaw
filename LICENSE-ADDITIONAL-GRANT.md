# Additional Use Grant (DzzenOS-OpenClaw)

This file supplements `LICENSE` (BUSL-1.1).

## Free Production Use for Small Organizations and Client Installations

Notwithstanding the “Production Use” restriction in BUSL-1.1, you are granted a free,
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive right to use the Licensed Work in Production,
without payment of fees to the Licensor, provided that:

1. Your organization’s Annual Gross Revenue is less than USD 1,000,000 (one million US dollars)
   in the most recently completed fiscal year; or your organization is a new business that has
   not yet completed its first fiscal year.

2. If you are a consultant, agency, or service provider deploying or configuring the Licensed Work
   on infrastructure owned or controlled by your client, your client’s Annual Gross Revenue satisfies
   the condition in (1) above. In that case, your client is deemed the “Licensee” for the purpose of
   this Additional Use Grant.

This Additional Use Grant does not permit you to:
- offer the Licensed Work, or any modified version of it, as a hosted or managed service to third parties,
  except on infrastructure owned or controlled by such third parties under the conditions above;
- resell, rebrand, or otherwise market the Licensed Work as your own product without a separate commercial
  agreement with the Licensor.

All other Production Use requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.
