# DzzenOS (OpenClaw Native) Docs

This folder is the **English** spec for the first open-source release.

Source of truth (drafts, RU) currently live in the Obsidian repo, but we will progressively port stable specs here.

Recommended reading order:
1) Product & Architecture
2) UI (Linear-like)
3) Automations (n8n-like)
4) Marketplace / Policies / Agent Packs
5) Chat bindings (Telegram topics / Slack threads)
