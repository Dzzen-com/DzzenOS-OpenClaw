# DzzenOS (OpenClaw Native) — Spec Index

This folder is a port of the working Obsidian specs into the main DzzenOS repo.

Reading order:
1) `01-Product (Native DzzenOS).md`
2) `02-Architecture (Local-first).md`
3) `06-UI (Linear-like).md`
4) `05-Automations (n8n-like).md`
5) `07-Marketplace (Curated Skills).md`
6) `08-Policies & Approvals (Skills + Actions).md`
7) `09-Agent Packs & Squads (Presets).md`
8) `12-Chat Bindings (Telegram Topics + Slack Threads).md`
9) `10-Roadmap (v1 vs later).md` + `11-Epics (v1).md`

Notes:
- These docs should be maintained in English going forward.
- Obsidian is still the drafting space; once stable, we sync/port into this folder.
