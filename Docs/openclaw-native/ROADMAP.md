# Roadmap (v1 vs later)

v1 focuses on a working local OS layer:
- Linear-like UI (boards + task drawer)
- Docs / context packs
- Agent packs + squads (at least 1–2)
- Runs / artifacts / approvals
- Automations MVP (React Flow + OpenClaw cron + webhooks)
- Curated marketplace MVP

Later:
- sync/backup
- richer integrations + node library
- versioning + migrations
- team mode
